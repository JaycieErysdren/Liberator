# Liberator
 
Liberator is a cross-platform, open-source file viewer powered by Tauri, three.js and KaitaiStruct. Its primary focus is to provide viewing and export support for various obscure binary formats, currently focused on the following areas:

- SlaveDriver Engine levels, textures, and sounds

With more to come.
